## Various Gran Turismo 3 NTSC Patches

## New Patches
After learning how to properly do the newer patches I will most likely be adding all cheats into a single file as you can toggle on and off what cheats you want to use. You can find the new patch file in the current directory **[8AA991B0.pnach](https://github.com/scottadkin/Gran-Turismo-3-NTSC-Patches/blob/main/8AA991B0.pnach)**.

## Old Patches
These are the old format non toggleable patches:
- Patches places in the **AllRaces** folder are for single race events, championship events, rally events, and Endurance events. Many will work in arcade mode and license tests as well like the power modifier cheats.
